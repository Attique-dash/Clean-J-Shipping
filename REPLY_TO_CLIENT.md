Hi,

Understood. Let's focus on finishing the current project and getting you shipping. The co-shipper feature can wait until you're ready.

**For the warehouse integration you asked about:**

I've prepared everything they need:

**Option 1: Web Portal (Easiest)**
- Add warehouse members through Admin portal
- They log in at /warehouse/packages and /warehouse/customers
- Ready to use immediately

**Option 2: API Integration**
- I've created complete API documentation
- Postman collection for testing
- All endpoints are live and ready

**What to send the warehouse:**
Ask them which they prefer:
- Portal access (add them as members)
- API endpoints (for system integration)
- Or both

I've attached:
- Complete API documentation
- Postman collection for testing
- Quick reference guide

**Project Status:**
Everything is deployed and ready. The system is fully functional for:
- Package management
- Customer portal
- Warehouse portal
- Invoice generation
- Payment processing

Once the warehouse confirms their preferred integration method, I can set it up immediately so you can start shipping.

Let me know what the warehouse decides and I'll get it configured right away.

Hi,

Got it. Let's finish this project and get you shipping. Co-shipper feature can wait.

**For warehouse integration:**

I've prepared everything. You have 2 options:

1. **Web Portal** - Add them as warehouse members (easiest)
2. **API Integration** - Share endpoints for their system

Ask the warehouse which they prefer, then I'll set it up immediately.

I've attached:
- API documentation
- Postman collection for testing
- Quick reference

Everything is deployed and ready. Once warehouse confirms, we can start shipping right away.

Let me know what they decide.
