Hi James,

Perfect! The API integration is ready. The warehouse can pull customer names and mailbox codes through the API.

**What they can pull:**
✅ Customer Name (FirstName + LastName)
✅ Mailbox Code (UserCode)
✅ Branch Location

**API Endpoint:**
GET /api/warehouse/pullcustomer/subdir?id=YOUR_API_KEY

**Response includes:**
- UserCode (this is the mailbox code)
- FirstName + LastName (customer name)
- Branch

I've prepared everything:
1. Postman Collection - All endpoints pre-configured for testing
2. API Documentation - Complete guide with examples
3. Quick Start Guide - Simple setup instructions

**Next steps:**
1. I'll provide the API key separately (for security)
2. Share the Postman collection and documentation with the warehouse
3. They can import and test immediately

The warehouse can also:
- Add packages
- Edit/update packages
- Delete packages
- Update manifest information

All endpoints are live and ready. Rate limit: 200 requests/minute for customer pulls.

Let me know once you've shared it with them, and I can help with any integration questions.

Best regards
